              <h3 class="ordered-article-heading">create a motivating goal for learning web development</h3>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Be Specific</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">The first thing that you will need to do after deciding to become a self taught web developer is make a very clear and specific goal for yourself to aim for. You have to have a reason important enough to keep you motivated and on task throughout your journey to becoming a self taught web developer.</p>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Have A Reason</h4>
              <p class="paragraph"> Are you learning to code to make more money so that you can take better care of your family? Are you doing it because you want to break into a safe and rapidly growing industry? Whatever your personal reason is for starting this journey will be the most important thing to keep in mind when the learning becomes difficult or you start to second guess yourself. </p>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Choose Your Niche</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">If you are an absolute beginner to learning code like I was, it will be important for you to do research on web development as a whole to help you decide on what your specific goal will be. Once you have a broad understanding of what web development actually is and what all of your options are, you will be able to choose the best path for yourself.  </p>
              <p class="paragraph">Do you want to be a front end developer, back end developer, or full stack developer? Do you want to be a freelancer and work for yourself or an employee of a tech company and earn a salary? It is up to you to decide on what you are going to do with the skills that you are developing. </p>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Put It In Writing</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">Once you have your goal in mind you have to write it down. When writing your goal down it is best to use strong words like “I will”, not passive words like “I want to”.  An example of a well written goal could be: <b class="bold">“I will learn how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so well that I will get hired by a company I want to work for and make at least $50,000 my first year!</b> ”</p> 
              <p class="paragraph">Post your goal somewhere visible that you will see multiple times per day. Read it when you wake up in the morning and before you go to bed at night time. This will constantly remind you of what to keep your focus on. It is good to be flexible with how you get to your goal, but be very rigid about what your goal ultimately is. </p>
