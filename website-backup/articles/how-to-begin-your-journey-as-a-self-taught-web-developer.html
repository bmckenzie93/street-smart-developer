              <h3 class="ordered-article-heading">create a motivating goal for learning web development</h3>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Be Specific</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">The first thing that you will need to do after deciding to become a self taught web developer is make a very clear and specific goal for yourself to aim for. You have to have a reason important enough to keep you motivated and on task throughout your journey to becoming a self taught web developer.</p>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Have A Reason</h4>
              <p class="paragraph"> Are you learning to code to make more money so that you can take better care of your family? Are you doing it because you want to break into a safe and rapidly growing industry? Whatever your personal reason is for starting this journey will be the most important thing to keep in mind when the learning becomes difficult or you start to second guess yourself. </p>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Choose Your Niche</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">If you are an absolute beginner to learning code like I was, it will be important for you to do research on web development as a whole to help you decide on what your specific goal will be. Once you have a broad understanding of what web development actually is and what all of your options are, you will be able to choose the best path for yourself.  </p>
              <p class="paragraph">Do you want to be a front end developer, back end developer, or full stack developer? Do you want to be a freelancer and work for yourself or an employee of a tech company and earn a salary? It is up to you to decide on what you are going to do with the skills that you are developing. </p>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Put It In Writing</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">Once you have your goal in mind you have to write it down. When writing your goal down it is best to use strong words like “I will”, not passive words like “I want to”.  An example of a well written goal could be: <b class="bold">“I will learn how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so well that I will get hired by a company I want to work for and make at least $50,000 my first year!</b> ”</p> 
              <p class="paragraph">Post your goal somewhere visible that you will see multiple times per day. Read it when you wake up in the morning and before you go to bed at night time. This will constantly remind you of what to keep your focus on. It is good to be flexible with how you get to your goal, but be very rigid about what your goal ultimately is. </p>
            </li>


            <li class="ordered-article-list-item">
              <h3 class="ordered-article-heading">MAKE AN ACTION PLAN FOR REACHING YOUR WEB DEVELOPMENT GOAL</h3>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Set A Study Time</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">Start by deciding how much time per week you can dedicate to learning web development. If you still live at home with your parents and have no bills to pay, you are one of the lucky few who should be able to dedicate a full time schedule to learning this stuff. I would suggest you set aside 40 hours per week minimum if you have the luxury to.</p>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">No Excuses</h4>
              <p class="paragraph"> If you are like I was when I first started learning (and a majority of the people reading this) then you probably have one or two jobs already and a family to take care of while you are learning this stuff. Don’t worry, you can absolutely become a web developer still.</p>
              <p class="paragraph"> If this is the case for you then you have to maximise on the time that you do have. If you can only study for an hour in the morning or an hour before bed then that is fine. It is much more important to get started and study consistently than it is to try and cram in 12 hour a day.</p>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Follow A Curriculum</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">As a self taught developer, you are going to learn your skill set from free or very inexpensive resources that you will find online. It is important to lay out a curriculum for yourself in the beginning to keep yourself focused and on track to reaching your goal. There is so much information out there and so many things you will feel like you need to learn. Have blinders for everything except the core technologies you need to reach your goal.</p>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Free Resources </h4>
              <p class="paragraph">I put together a list of resources below to help you out with getting started. I am not sponsored by or affiliated with anybody listed below, they are just some of the resources I used when I first began that benefitted me. </p> 
              <ul class="inner-ul">
                <li class="inner-li"><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" class="inner-link">Free Code Camp</a></li>
                <li class="inner-li"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb" class="inner-link">Traversey Media</a></li>
                <li class="inner-li"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Tychos1" class="inner-link">Joshua Fluke</a></li>
                <li class="inner-li"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q" class="inner-link">Dev Ed</a></li>
                <li class="inner-li"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/noobtoprofessional" class="inner-link">Chris Hawkes</a></li>
                <li class="inner-li"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_9Kj_Zp9yv4dtv2VnVXkTA" class="inner-link">Joe Santos</a></li>
                <li class="inner-li"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/techSithTube" class="inner-link">TechSith</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p class="paragraph">I always suggest the first place someone goes to learn their basics be Free Code Camp. They have a structured learning path for both front end and back end web development technologies available for free. They even offer certificates of completion at the end of their courses that you could use on your resume.</p>

            <li class="ordered-article-list-item">
              <h3 class="ordered-article-heading">Follow Through With Your Plan</h3>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Take Your Time</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">Don’t be in such a hurry to learn that you burn yourself out by trying to cram in 12 hour days back to back, over and over. Feeding our brains information is like feeding water to plants - we need time to rest and absorb the information we give ourselves, just like plants need time to rest and absorb the water we saturate their soil with.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">You can try and force feed your brain information quickly, but you will not retain all of the knowledge. Keep a steady pace and you will win the race.</p>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Stay Focused On The Goal</h4>
              <p class="paragraph"> You will come across all kinds of videos and articles that will tell you why you need to learn ‘this’ framework and ‘that’ library. If it isn’t necessary to immediately reach your goal then it will be a distraction and waste your time. It is important to understand exactly what you need to learn to reach your specific goal, and focus only on those things. </p>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Choose Your Niche</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">If you are an absolute beginner to learning code like I was, it will be important for you to do research on web development as a whole to help you decide on what your specific goal will be. Once you have a broad understanding of what web development actually is and what all of your options are, you will be able to choose the best path for yourself.  </p>
              <p class="paragraph">Do you want to be a front end developer, back end developer, or full stack developer? Do you want to be a freelancer and work for yourself or an employee of a tech company and earn a salary? It is up to you to decide on what you are going to do with the skills that you are developing. </p>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Put It In Writing</h4>

            </li>


            <li class="ordered-article-list-item">
              <h3 class="ordered-article-heading"> JOIN A WEB DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY</h3>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Find People Online</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">One of the easiest ways to find a local community to join in your area is going to be <a class="inner-link" href="https://www.meetup.com/">meetup.com</a>. Just go on there and search for any sort of web development or technology groups in your area. Finding a local community is a great way to begin your network. You could possibly find some freelance work or opportunities for contributing to open source projects you could mention on your resume.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">There are also online communities you could join and become a part of such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" class="inner-link">stackoverflow.com</a>. Interacting with other developers and hearing how they think and talk will give you insight into the web development world. </p>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Provide Value</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">Once you are in a community or two try and add as much value as you can. Join in on conversations and give your input during discussions, even if you don't feel like you know much. It will benefit everyone if you put yourself out there. Let everyone know what you are learning and what your goal is.</p>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Doors Will Open</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">When I joined my first online web development community I was intimidated at first because I wasn't sure if I knew enough to be accepted or if anyone would give me the time of day. To my pleasure everyone was extremely nice and supportive. They even offered me the opportunity to work on an open source project with them during our second meeting.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">After helping out with the open source project for about two weeks they offered me another project to work on, but that one would be paid. </p>
              <p class="paragraph">They offered me $30 an hour out of the gate! It was my first time being paid to do web development, so I was super excited and appreciative. I learned all the skills I needed to get that opportunity online, for free, in under a year, while raising a family and working. </p>

              <h4 class="inner-heading">Put It In Writing</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">Once you have your goal in mind you have to write it down. When writing your goal down it is best to use strong words like “I will”, not passive words like “I want to”.  An example of a well written goal could be: <b class="bold">“I will learn how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so well that I will get hired by a company I want to work for and make at least $50,000 my first year!</b> ”</p>

          <h3 class="inner-heading">CONCLUSION</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">The first 4 steps anybody who is brand new to learning web development should take are:</p>
